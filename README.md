```

Time Spend: almost 4 hours
Time Range: 9:00pm - 00:56 (the next day after i recieved the email test)

reasoning:
for the explanation why i only work on the post section, i decided to only work on that section cause the test page is more into users posts and interaction with other users since boo is a social media platform/dating platform, i think it is more important to more focus on that for the users

I skipped many things and more focus on the post section, i don't usually use nextjs with page routing
mostly i use app route for my project, i spend much time more in trying to figure out page routing behavior and the styling
cause somehow the new nextjs 16 does not include the tailwind file configuration so i had to fix that

this project does not include any frontend component framework like headlessui, heroui, shadcnui and ect
i don't use that for the test, might be a good idea to use that in the future test

whats also missing inside this project beside the feature and section is the metadata for the SEO, i didn't include that in the test
