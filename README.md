Time Spend: 4 hours

I skipped many things and more focus on the post section, i don't usually use nextjs with page routing
mostly i use app route for my project, i spend much time more in trying to figure out page routing behavior and the styling
cause somehow the new nextjs 16 does not include the tailwind file configuration so i had to fix that

this project does not include any frontend component framework like headlessui, heroui, shadcnui and ect
i don't use that for the test, might be a good idea to use that in the future test
